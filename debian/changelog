scim-hangul (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, thanks to Anho Ki's help.  (Closes: #432926)
    - Add build dependency libhangul-dev (>= 0.0.4).
  * Rewrite debian/rules.
    - Use the platform detection code recommended by autotools-dev.
    - Remove binary-common target and separate binary-arch and binary-indep
      targets completely.
    - Fix Makefile (about disabling skim support) in config.status target
      instead of clean target.
  * Remove dpatch build dependency as there is no Debian patches anymore.
    Also remove related targets in debian/rules.
  * Update debian/copyright.
    - Use the correct license notice.  It should be GPL v2 or later, not GPL
      v2 only.  Also refer to the /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 file for
      license text instead of the /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL symlink.
    - Add note about current Debian maintainers.
    - Update dates in the upstream copyright notice.
    - Add note about Debian packaging's copyright and license.
  * Change co-maintainer Ming Hua's email address.

scim-hangul (0.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adapt to the $(moduledir) change in scim 1.4.6.  (Closes: #424012)
    - Bump build dependency to libscim-dev (>= 1.4.6).
    - Drop 10scim-plugin-module-install-dir dpatch, no longer needed.
    - Use wildcard "*" instead of hardcoded "1.4.0" for scim module path in
      debian/install and debian/rules, making it possible to binNMU when scim
      module ABI changes.
  * Add scim to dependency.  All IM module packages should depend on scim,
    because they would be useless without scim installed.  Users only need to
    install the IM module package they need and should get scim automatically.
  * Update debian/watch to use the qa.debian.org redirect URL for
    sourceforge.net.
  * Upgarde to policy version 3.7.2.2, no actual changes needed.
